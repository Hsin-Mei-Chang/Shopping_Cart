# Shopping_Cart
Simple demo with the shopping cart scenario.

Extend the following functionality and corresponding test cases, and run the tests successfully in GitHub Actions:

Allow the user to input and delete the corresponding product ID from the shopping cart.
If the product ID entered by the user does not exist in the shopping cart, output an error message.

Update the unittest to handle the deletion of the corresponding product ID.
